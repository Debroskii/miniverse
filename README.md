## Ever wanted to see 5800 solar systems on your screen?

No? Can't relate, that's why I made this. It is a P5.js based rendered of universe of over 5800 individual and unique solar systems (they each have their own name too!). 
Use the sidebar (or the bottom bar on mobile) to navigate and move to any solar system you'd like! On desktop, you can press __H__ to hide the sidebar, but there's more too.
Only on desktop you can press __S__ to show the bounds of the solar system regions, of which there are 1500!

Thanks for checking it out! Cheers!
